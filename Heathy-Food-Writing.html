  <h2>Example Blog Post</h2>
  <div class="example-post">
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
    I really like eating chocolate and chips. They taste amazing and make me feel happy for a little while. I know that these foods are not very healthy and that eating too much of them can be bad for my body.</p>

    <p><strong>Body / Development</strong><br>
    Even though I enjoy these treats, I try not to eat them every day. I limit myself because I understand that too much sugar and fat can harm my health. Instead, I try to eat more fruits and vegetables. I especially like apples, carrots, and spinach, which give me energy and make me feel good. I also drink lots of water to stay healthy.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
    I have learned that it is okay to enjoy unhealthy food sometimes, but it is important to eat healthy food most of the time. By balancing treats and healthy meals, I feel better and have more energy for school and sports. My goal is to keep enjoying sweets in moderation and focus on eating more nutritious foods every day.</p>
